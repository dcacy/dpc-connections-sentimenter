    summary: 'From the Huffinton Post " When it comes to consumerism, millennials are fascinated by things that are different and new. This is a generation that is always on the hunt for unique products and services. Halloween is the one holiday that provides them with that. Every year there are costumes that are considered to be the hottest or on trend, something that hasn\'t been seen over and over again, something that sets you apart from the crowd and millennials buy into this. They want to be the first to sport a conversation-worthy costume so they can share that on social media and trend something new. According to Pinterest, the top 2 Halloween costume trends of 2015 include DIY costumes with millennials preferring to coordinate their costumes with groups of friends. The second biggest trend this year is throwback costumes, with \'90\'s costume ideas making a big comeback. " We need 90\'s costumes!!',

This year\'s most coveted get-up: Superheros. So far it\'s superheroes across the board: For kids for adults for pets said Lorenzo Caltagirone owner of Total Fright a year-round costume shop in Arlington. The female superhero in particular has really taken off. This is the year of girl power. Among the biggest sellers so far Caltagirone says are Supergirl and Harley Quinn the DC Comics supervillain. The shift comes in a year packed with superhero movies including Deadpool Suicide Squad and X-Men: Apocalypse. Batman and Superman sparred on the big screen while Captain American duked it out with Iron Man. But action flicks aren\'t just dominating the silver screen: The television network CW has four superhero shows in its fall line-up including Supergirl Arrow and DC\'s Legends of Tomorrow while DC Super Hero Girls has its own video series on YouTube. The movie industry has a huge impact on costuming so that\'s part of it Caltagirone said. But then again who doesn\'t want to be a superhero? Halloween is the one day of the year you can get away with it.',

    summary: 'Amy, for Halloween I agree marketing to the adult segment makes sense but we have to be SMART about this. We are a family owned company and our moral reputation is on display. I want to make sure ALL costumes are PG 13 .. NO risque Halloween costumes should be sold!!! I say we pull together our designers and tell them EXACTLY what are expectations are and we will except no less. If we attack this right it will be great for our bottom line as well as keep the high company standards that we are know for.',

    summary: 'Halloween? What are we celebrating? This is a made up holiday that just gives kids a disguise to go out and cause havoc in the neighborhood. Every time a house gets egged, a tree TPd, windows soaped, etc.. the police should be called and the hooligans should be arrested. Let\'s not encourage this behavior! Let\'s leave the Halloween costume business for good. We need to expand into other market segments such as Veterans day, Fourth of July, or Christmas. Real holidays that have a meaning.',

    summary: 'Costumes are supposed to be scary, @Frank Adams20466521​. The whole point of Halloween is to celebrate All Hallows Eve. Halloween customs are thought to have been influenced by folk customs and beliefs from the Celtic-speaking countries some of which are believed to have pagan roots. Jack Santino a folklorist writes that there was throughout Ireland an uneasy truce existing between customs and beliefs associated with Christianity and those associated with religions that were Irish before Christianity arrived. Historian Nicholas Rogers exploring the origins of Halloween notes that while some folklorists have detected its origins in the Roman feast of Pomona the goddess of fruits and seeds or in the festival of the dead called Parentalia it is more typically linked to the Celtic festival of Samhain which comes from the Old Irish for summer\'s end. Samhain (pronounced sah-win or sow-in) was the first and most important of the four quarter days in the medieval Gaelic calendar and was celebrated in Ireland Scotland and the Isle of Man. It was held on or about 31 October - 1 November and a kindred festival was held at the same time of year by the Brittonic Celts; called Calan Gaeaf in Wales Kalan Gwav in Cornwall and Kalan GoaÌ±v in Brittany. Samhain and Calan Gaeaf are mentioned in some of the earliest Irish and Welsh literature. The names have been used by historians to refer to Celtic Halloween customs up until the 19th century and are still the Gaelic and Welsh names for Halloween.',
